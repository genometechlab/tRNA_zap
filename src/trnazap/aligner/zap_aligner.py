    """Execute tRNA basecall alignment and inference workflow.

    This function orchestrates the entire tRNA-zap workflow: it loads the appropriate
    reference based on the selected model, processes the reference to create a BAM
    header and reference lookup dictionary, loads inference data, splits read IDs
    for parallel processing, and distributes the work across multiple threads.

    Args:
        unaligned_bam (str): Path to the basecalled BAM file paired with pod5 input
            used for model inference.
        inference_list (list): List of paths to tRNA model inference result files,
            potentially from multiple sequencing runs.
        out_dir (str): Output directory path. Will attempt to create if it
        doesn't exist.
        out_pre (str): Prefix to be appended to all output files.
        threads (int): Number of processing threads to use for parallel execution.
        model (str): Target tRNA substrate. Either 'yeast' or 'e_coli'. Selects
            both the reference and the default scoring profile.
        secondary (bool): Also align the second highest classification and keep
            the better of the two alignments.
        ident_threshold, wf_gap_open, wf_gap_extend, sw_gap_open, sw_gap_extend,
            sw_match, sw_mismatch (float or None): Scoring parameters. None takes
            the value from the selected profile, anything else overrides it.
        max_query_length (int or None): Longest query, in bases, that either the
            Wagner-Fisher or the Smith-Waterman stage will attempt. Reads above
            this are left unmapped, bounding the time and memory a single
            pathological read can consume. None takes the profile value.
        ivt_alignment (bool): Use the in vitro transcribed scoring profile for
            the substrate rather than the biological one.
        pickled (bool): Treat the inference input as a pre-pickled object.

    Returns:
        None: Function completes without an explicit return value on success.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the selected model is not a recognized substrate.

    Note:
        The function maps the selected model to corresponding reference files,
        loads the reference, processes inference data, and distributes read alignment
        work in parallel across the specified number of threads.
